# How do I approach designing software? What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft? What design process did you follow for your project work? How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

I approach designing software by first understanding exactly what the client expectations and software requirements are. The new design skills I've used to help craft this project
include working with the Modern OpenGL library. The design process I followed included translating client requirements (a low-polygon, 3D approximation of a scene) into a working 3D
representation of a 2D scene. The design process involved creating primitive 3D objects, placing them in a scene relative to each other, and using linear algebra to translate 
the camera perspective to a 2D surface (the computer monitor). Working with an extensive library like OpenGL has provided me with invaluable experience that I can use when approaching
problems in the future that require the use of large, complex libraries.

# How do I approach developing programs? What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene? How did iteration factor into your development? How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

My approach at developing this project changed throughout the milestones. At first, I wasn't incrementally developing the project, as there was a lot of set up for getting the OpenGL
enviroment functioning. This was because I was still learning how to use the library. As we neared the final milestone, my approach to developing each subsequent part involved 
developing the project incrementally. That is, I made changes to my project slowly, and made only a few changes at a time, until I has a completed deliverable.

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals? How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational and professional pathway?

Computational graphics and visualizations has given me new knoweledge of how to work on large projects, the experience of which will be invaluable in my professional career path.
As for my eduacational path, knowing how to set up my evironment with large, complex libaries will be invaluable knowledge for my future coursework.
